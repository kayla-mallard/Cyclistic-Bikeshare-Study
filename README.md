## Summary Analysis for Cyclistic Bikeshare

Through my analysis, it is clear that annual members of the bike-share service use the service more often, and casual members typically use the bikeshare service less often. The bike-share service's most busy days range from Monday-Friday for members, while Saturday and Sunday are most popular among casual riders.

It would seem that members use the service during the week for work related travel. Casual riders use the service less often and seemingly use the service for casual rides or running quick errands.

Tuesday is the most popular day of the week, followed by Thursday, then Friday. Surprisingly, weekends are the least popular. Saturday is the least popular day among both casual riders and members.

## My Top 3 Recommendations Based On My Analysis

#### Recommendation 1:

Incentives should be offered to encourage casual riders to become annual members. These incentives could target different groups based on the incentive. Becoming an annual member could save money for those more frugal or on a budget, becoming a member can encourage others to use the service more often as a form of physical activity, and using a bike-share service as a daily source of transportation is better for the environment, which may be important to environmentally conscious riders. Creating an incentive or discount that encourages riders to use the bike-share service more during weekends could also be helpful.

#### Recommendation 2:

Create an ad set aimed towards the working class in areas the bike-share service is available or create a promotion targeting students and workers. This would boost the visibility of the bike-share service. Increasing membership awareness should be a new priority because members are shown to use the service more regularly.

#### Recommendation 3:

Survey both annual members and casual riders. Inquire about their satisfaction with the bike-share service, what would encourage a casual rider to become a member, why members chose to become members, why riders use this service, and any recommendations they may have.
