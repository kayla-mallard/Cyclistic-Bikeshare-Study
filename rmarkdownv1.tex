\subsection{Summary Analysis for Cyclistic
Bikeshare}\label{summary-analysis-for-cyclistic-bikeshare}

Through my analysis, it is clear that annual members of the bike-share
service use the service more often, and casual members typically use the
bikeshare service less often. The bike-share service's most busy days
range from Monday-Friday for members, while Saturday and Sunday are most
popular among casual riders.

It would seem that members use the service during the week for work
related travel. Casual riders use the service less often and seemingly
use the service for casual rides or running quick errands.

Tuesday is the most popular day of the week, followed by Thursday, then
Friday. Surprisingly, weekends are the least popular. Saturday is the
least popular day among both casual riders and members.

\subsection{My Top 3 Recommendations Based On My
Analysis}\label{my-top-3-recommendations-based-on-my-analysis}

\paragraph{Recommendation 1:}\label{recommendation-1}

Incentives should be offered to encourage casual riders to become annual
members. These incentives could target different groups based on the
incentive. Becoming an annual member could save money for those more
frugal or on a budget, becoming a member can encourage others to use the
service more often as a form of physical activity, and using a
bike-share service as a daily source of transportation is better for the
environment, which may be important to environmentally conscious riders.
Creating an incentive or discount that encourages riders to use the
bike-share service more during weekends could also be helpful.

\paragraph{Recommendation 2:}\label{recommendation-2}

Create an ad set aimed towards the working class in areas the bike-share
service is available or create a promotion targeting students and
workers. This would boost the visibility of the bike-share service.
Increasing membership awareness should be a new priority because members
are shown to use the service more regularly.

\paragraph{Recommendation 3:}\label{recommendation-3}

Survey both annual members and casual riders. Inquire about their
satisfaction with the bike-share service, what would encourage a casual
rider to become a member, why members chose to become members, why
riders use this service, and any recommendations they may have.

\subsection{How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?}\label{how-do-annual-members-and-casual-riders-use-cyclistic-bikes-differently}

These are the key findings found about the differences between annual
members and casual riders throughout the year, based on the data
provided from 2019-2020.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Annual members typically ride more during the week and less during
  weekends.
\item
  Casual riders ride more often on weekends.
\item
  Annual members use the bike-share service more often than casual
  riders, while casual riders typically take less trips but more often
  ride longer distances.
\item
  Annual members seemingly use the bike-share service for work-related
  travel because they ride more often throughout the week and less
  during the weekend.
\item
  However, Members still use the service more often than casual members.
\item
  Casual members seemingly ride more spontaneously, for fun, or to run
  quick errands- more often during weekends and less during week days.
\item
  Most popular days in order are Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
\item
  The least popular day is Saturday, then Sunday.
